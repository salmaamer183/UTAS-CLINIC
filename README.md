# UTAS-CLINIC
About
The graduation project was based on my idea to develop the university by establishing UTAS-CLINIC, aiming to contribute to creating a healthy and educational environment. The clinic provides healthcare services for students and staff while promoting health awareness and continuous learning within the campus.
