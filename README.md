# UTAS-CLINIC
About
The graduation project was based on my idea to develop the university by establishing UTAS-CLINIC, aiming to contribute to creating a healthy and educational environment. The clinic provides healthcare services for students and staff while promoting health awareness and continuous learning within the campus.

The project file can be viewed online via the university website [(https://utas-clinic-app-c.onrender.com/login)]. Due to privacy, email access is not required.
